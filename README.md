### (1) Observational Unit: One Mile World Record Progression Times (also known as the "Bannister" Effect)

#### Sharp RDD:

#### Kernel Reg.:

### (2) Observational Unit: New Observational unit

e.g. other record time progressions (i) in running (ii) over various distances (iii) in other sports providing similar threshold values (with associated beliefs that no person can achieve better stated in a pre-period)

### (3) Spillovers -> SUTVA Violation:
 DiD and IV on all Times (Y) around the relevant Threshold Th and Y0 (where Threshold associated with Bannister-like beliefs in a pre-period e.g. by assumption a sharp-limit)
